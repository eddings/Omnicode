# Compupte the difference between the minimum and maximum values
- In this problem, you will compute the difference between the minimum and maximum values of an array of numbers.

def diffMinMax(nums):

    Difference between the minimum and maxmimum values

    Find the difference bewteen the minimum and maximum values of the given array, nums

    For example, the minimum value of [1,2,3] is 1, and the maximum value of [1,2,3] is 3, hence the difference between the two is 3 - 1 = 2.

    Compute the difference such that its value is always positive, i.e. absolute difference.

    Assume that the array contains at least two numbers.

    ------
    >>> print diffMinMax([1,3])
    2
    >>> print diffMinMax([1,3,2])
    2
    >>> print diffMinMax([7,3,1,5,6])
    6
    >>> print diffMinMax([7,3,1,6,7,8,9,1,3,3,3,2])
