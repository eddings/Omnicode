    Mean, median value difference

    - Find the difference bewteen mean and median values of the given list, nums

    - For example, the mean of [1,2,3] is 2, and the median of [1,2,3] is also 2, hence the difference between the two is 2 - 2 = 0.

    - Compute the difference such that its value is always positive, i.e. absolute difference.
