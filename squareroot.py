# Squareroot of a Number

Find the squareroot of a given number rounded down to the nearest integer, without using the sqrt function.
For example, squareroot of a number between [9, 15] should return 3, and [16, 24] should be 4.

- The straightforward way to solve this problem has the complexity of O(N), which is pretty inefficient.
