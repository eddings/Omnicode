{"labID":"intro_programming","labDoc":{"labDesc":"Just when you had become an expert at string slicing, you discovered another sliceable data type:lists. However, lists are different from strings in that they are mutable. Not only can we slice a list, but we can also change its contents. The purpose of the lab is to introduce you to these new features, and demonstrate just how powerful the list type can be.<br>This lab will also give you some experience writing functions with for-loops. While lists will be on the first exam, for-loops are on the second exam, after you have had more practice with them.<br><b>Lab Materials</b>. We have created several Python files for this lab. You can download all of the labs from the Labs section of the course web page.<br><a href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2016fa/labs'>http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2016fa/labs</a><br><b>Getting Credit for the Lab</b>. Once again, you have a choice between getting credit through the online system or your instructor. The online lab is available at the web page<br><a href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2016fa/labs/lab07/'>http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2016fa/labs/lab07/</a><br>By now you should have a good idea of which version you are more comfortable with. This lab involves quite a bit of coding, so you may have trouble finishing it during lab time. Fortunately, <b>you have two weeks this time to finish the lab</b>.<br>Your instructor will record that you did it. Remember, despite the demands of the online system, labs are graded on effort, not correctness.","checkpoints":[{"title":"List Expressions and Commands","desc":"The first part of the lab will take place in the Python interactive prompt, much like the first two labs. You do not need to create a module. First, execute the following assignment statement:<br>lablist = ['H','e','l','l','o',' ','W','o','r','l','d','!']<br>Like a string, this is a list of individual characters. Unlike a string, however, the contents of this list can be changed. This makes lists a very important data type.<br>Enter the following statements <b>in the order they are presented</b>. Many of the commands below are always type in expressions, Python will immediately display the value; the commands below are all followed by a print statement showing the new contents of the list. Unlike previous labs, we are not asking you to guess the output beforehand.","commandBlocks":[{"commands":"lablist.remove('o')<br>print lablist"},{"commands":"lablist.remove('x')"},{"commands":"pos = lablist.index('o')<br>print pos"},{"commands":"pos = lablist.index('B')"},{"commands":"lablist[0] = 'J'<br>print lablist"},{"commands":"lablist.insert(4,'o')<br>print lablist"},{"commands":"s = lablist[:]<br>print s"},{"commands":"s[0] = 'C'<br>print s<br>print lablist"},{"commands":"a = '-'.join(s)<br>print a"},{"commands":"a = ''.join(s)<br>print a"},{"commands":"t = list(a)<br>print t"}],"testCases":[],"questions":[{"questioner":"test","question":"How do you print text in Python?","answers":[{"answerer":"asdf","answer":"You can use 'print'.

The stubs for these functions are in the editor. You will need to use for-loops to implement them. In addition, we have already provided you with test cases. So all you need to do is implement the functions.<br>In addition to using a for-loop, you may find the following list methods useful.<table><tr><th>Method</th><th>Result When Called</th></tr><tr><td>l.index(c)</td><td><b>Returns</b>: the first position of c in list l; error if not there</td></tr><tr><td>l.count(c)</td><td><b>Returns</b>: the number of times that c appears in the list l.</td></tr><tr><td>l.append(c)</td><td>Adds the value c to the end of the list. This method alters the list; it does not make a new list.</td></tr></table><br><p>Lists do not have a find() method like strings do. They only have index(). To check if an element is in a list, use the in operator (e.g. x in thelist).<br><b>Function</b> lesser_than(thelist, value).<br>The function below <b>should not alter</b> thelist. If you need to call a method that might alter the contents of thelist, you should make a copy of it first.<br><b>Function</b> uniques(thelist).<br>Once again, the function below <b>should not alter</b> thelist. If you need to call a method that might alter the contents of thelist, you should make a copy of it first.<br><b>Function</b> clamp(thelist,min,max).<br>Unlike the previous two functions, this function does alter thelist. This function is a procedure with no return value. You might want to look at test cases to see how we would test a procedure like this.</p>","commandBlocks":[],"testCases":[{"commands":"# Walker M.
